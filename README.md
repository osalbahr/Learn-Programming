You may notice C++ files or other languages. That is because sometimes I write a solution in a more familiar language first.

## I/O

Input/output is similar to Python, Bash, and C.

### Reading Example

```rb
word = gets
```

### Writing Example

```rb
puts "Hello, World!"
```

### Strings

The worst part in any language.

Luckily, strings in Ruby can be manipulated similarly to Python via square bracket indexing (i.e. `[i]`). For example:

```console
% ruby
word = gets
puts word[0]
^D
lol
l
```
